# SongPreview

This mod allows you to play a snippet ranging from 5 to 20 seconds (changed in the mod's settings) when licking the preview button on a song widget.

Features:
    - Show preview button on all song widgets (even the ones in the level selection screen)
    - Preview both downloaded and non-downloaded songs
    - idk bruh

The snippet is fetched and downloaded on button click, then it is cached until the next game launch, where it is deleted.
